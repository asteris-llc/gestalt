## gestalt schema delete

delete a schema

### Synopsis


Delete an existing schema, specified by `name`. If the `--delete-keys` flag is set, the API will also delete any keys that are specified in the schema being deleted. In successful cases, this command does not print anything. This command corresponds to calling `DELETE /v1/schemas/{name}`. The `--delete-keys` flag corresponds to the `deleteKeys` query string option.

```
gestalt schema delete {name}
```

### Options

```
      --delete-keys[=false]: also delete configuration keys
```

### Options inherited from parent commands

```
      --host="localhost:3000": API hostname
      --pretty[=true]: pretty-print responses
      --scheme="http": set the request scheme
      --timeout=20s: set the request timeout
```
